 * Samples random values from the normal (Gaussian) probability distribution,
 * centered on 0. This sampler works in a way that first samples from a
 * normal_cumulative with some small sigma and then using another sampling from
 * uniform distribution creates a candidate for the output, which is accepted
 * or rejected with certain probability.  Note that the sampler offers
 * arbitrary precision but the implementation is not constant time.
