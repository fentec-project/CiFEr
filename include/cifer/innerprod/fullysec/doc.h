/**
 * \defgroup fullysec Fully secure schemes
 * Fully secure schemes for functional encryption of inner products.
 *
 * All implementations in this package are based on the reference paper by
 * Agrawal, Libert and Stehl√© (see https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/608.pdf), and
 * offer adaptive security under chosen-plaintext attacks (IND-CPA security).
 *
 * The reference scheme is public key, which means that no master secret key is
 * required for the encryption.
 *
 * For instantiation from the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (DDH), see
 * struct damgard (and its multi-input variant damgard_multi, which is a secret
 * key scheme, because a part of the secret key is required for the encryption).
 *
 * For instantiation from learning with errors (LWE), see struct lwe_fs.
