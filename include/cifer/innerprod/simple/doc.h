/**
 * \defgroup simple Simple schemes
 * Simple schemes for functional encryption of inner products.
 * All implementations in this package are based on the reference paper by
 * Abdalla et. al (see https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/017.pdf). The reference
 * scheme offers selective security under chosen-plaintext attacks (s-IND-CPA
 * security).
 *
 * The reference scheme is public key, which means that no master secret key is
 * required for the encryption.
 *
 * For instantiation from the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (DDH), see
 * struct ddh (and its multi-input variant ddh_multi, which is a secret key
 * scheme, because a part of the secret key is required for the encryption).
 *
 * For instantiation from learning with errors (LWE), see structs lwe and
 * ring_lwe.
