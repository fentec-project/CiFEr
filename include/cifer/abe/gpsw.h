 * \brief Key policy attribute based scheme.
 *
 * This is a key policy (KP) attribute based (ABE) scheme based
 * on Goyal, Pandey, Sahai, Waters: "Attribute-Based Encryption for
 * Fine-Grained Access Control of Encrypted Data"
 * We abbreviated it GPSW scheme to honor the authors. This scheme
 * enables distribution of keys based on a boolean expression determining
 * which attributes are needed for an entity to be able to decrypt. Each
 * key is connected to some attribute, such that only a set of keys
 * whose attributes are sufficient can decrypt the massage. This scheme
 * is a PUBLIC-KEY scheme - no master secret key is needed to encrypt
 * the messages.
