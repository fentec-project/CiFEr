/**
 * cfe_msp represents a monotone span program (MSP) describing a policy defining which

 * allows decryption of an entity with a set of attributes A if an only if all the
 * rows of the matrix mapped to an element of A span the vector [1, 0,..., 0] (or
 * vector [1, 1,..., 1] depending on the use case).

 * integers (hence they must not be greater than what int can hold) separated
 * with AND and OR gates, with brackets defining the order of the gates.
