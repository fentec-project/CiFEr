* \brief This is a key policy (KP) attribute based (ABE) scheme based
* on Goyal, Pandey, Sahai, Waters: "Attribute-Based Encryption for
* Fine-Grained Access Control of Encrypted Data"
* We abbreviated it GPSW scheme to honor the authors. This scheme
* enables distribution of keys based on a boolean expression determining
* which attributes are needed for an entity to be able to decrypt. Each
* key is connected to some attribute, such that only a set of keys
* whose attributes are sufficient can decrypt the massage. This scheme
* is a PUBLIC-KEY scheme - no master secret key is needed to encrypt
* the messages.
