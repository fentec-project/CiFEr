* \brief This is a ciphertext policy (CP) attribute based (ABE) scheme based
* on Shashank Agrawal and Melissa Chase: "FAME: Fast Attribute-based Message
* Encryption"
* This scheme enables encrypting a message based on a boolean expression
* determining which attributes are needed for an entity to be able to decrypt.
* Each key is connected to some attribute, such that only a set of keys
* whose attributes are sufficient can decrypt the massage. This scheme
* is a PUBLIC-KEY scheme - no master secret key is needed to encrypt
* the messages.
